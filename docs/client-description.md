## **Arcade Hall Business Case**

The ArcadeHall company is an on-place playing hall, where its members can play all kinds of arcade games. Throughout the last couple of years, they have had a much larger request for their games to be online as well as on place.
At the moment “ArcadeHall” does not have any kind of website and therefore they hope for a high quality developed website.

The “ArcadeHall” wishes for a website where its members can sign in so they can see their highscores as well as their friends' highscores. They also want the first two games to be “UNO” and “CHESS” because they have a lot of members playing these two games.

Currently, they have a high score system for each physical arcade game, but for their website ArcadeHall wants a new ranking system (based on rating) for each game and one that combines the total rankings from all the games of the ArcadeHall.

“ArcadeHall” also hopes for some kind of administrator log in where the admin can see how many players have been playing the last month and which games they have been playing

At last, they wish for a long term cooperation so there through time can be a lot of games and new games on their site.
